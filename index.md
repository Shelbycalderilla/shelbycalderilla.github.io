## Favorite CPSC 120L Lab's 

* Lab 2 part 1 

  Though this lab wasn't the first lab that we did, it was still a beginner intro level lab that
felt like it wasn't too hard to do while also being super easy. I found it enjoyable to actually
use what we were working on in class in the lab for the first time properly without the lab being
super simplified like the first one. It felt like a good opener for the class and was more unforgettable. 

* Lab 6 part 1

  This lab was one of my favorites to code because of what we had to do. We were building a sandwich and
it was really cool to put in all the parts to get the correct inputs. I found it really cool how it ended
up printing and it was super unique to see how that is actually written in code. 

* Lab 7 part 1

  This lab was one of my favorites because of the inputs that we had to do. I found it really fun and interesting
what code went in to have it print out what it did. This lab was the one where we had to put in the parking
rules for the differents streets, and i found it really fun it input all the information we had.
